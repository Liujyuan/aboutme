I'm **Jiyuan Liu (刘纪源)**, a Master's student at the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://cse.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). I am part of the research group led by Associate Professor [Yanghui Rao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qg7gv20AAAAJ). Before that, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree from the [Software College](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/) at [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/), where I was affiliated with the research group of Distinguished Professor [Yongshun Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qg7gv20AAAAJ). I was recommended for postgraduate studies (exemption from examination) based on my academic performance, ranking in the top 8% (24/300).

Currently, my research interests focus on **knowledge mining and discovery, specifically exploring AI co-scientists, topic models, concept alignment, and other LLM applications**.
